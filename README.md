# sample-models
This repository is to 
(1) build a tensorflow model through transfer learning approach,
(2) train the model using flower dataset (5 categories),
(3) Fine tune the model and save the trained model,
(4) convert the model to tflite_model format,
(5) build a classification model on an Android device,
(6) deploy end-to-end model in GCP, and
(7) convert same model to tfjs format and deploy on website
